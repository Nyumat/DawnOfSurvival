### DawnOfSurvival [OSX]

A text based, survival game that can be played in either the macOS Terminal or Xcode command line. 

Dawn of Survival places you in the point-of-view of one of many characters to play as. Your goal is to simply survive as long as possible until adequate help can arrive. 

## The Development Process

Building this game wasn't too difficult, as there are no assets/OOP to worry about. However, this was my introduction to using  structs in Swift,
so it created some unwanted stresses/pains. The game is ran within a loop, that over time adds and diminishes certain xp point atrributes depending on wheter
you're eating, etc. etc.

## To run the game..

Because this is made in Xcode, all you'll need to do is download the .xcodeproj file and run it in the terminal.
